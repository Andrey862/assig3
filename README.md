# Assignment3
 Traveling salesman problem via Simulated Annealing

The notebook is a report

The defenition of the energy is the same as in the assignment
Scheduling is geometrical


## The best path animation:
```
Number of iterations: 10_000_000
Initial temperature = 2_000_000
Cooloing geometric coefficient =  0.9999990096517352 (final T will be 100)
Achived distance = 1.216156 millions kilometers
```
